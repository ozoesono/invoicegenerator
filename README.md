## Problem Overview
Designing an application that can generate invoices from SMS feeder files.

## Solution Design

	
## Technologies Used
Project is created with:
* Java 8 as the development language
* Gradle as the build automation tool and package manager
	
## Specific Libraries Used
Important Java Libraries used for the project:
* Lombok: Used to reduce boiler plate code associated with Java
* Apache Commons CSV: Used for Parsing CSV/Excel files
* Freemarker: Used for generating HTML files
	
## Important Notes
My solution has not provided any extensive error handling, nor have I created custom Exception classes for the application. I felt this was outside the scope of the problem domain.


## Running the Application
This project is simple Lorem ipsum dolor generator.
	

```
$ cd ../lorem
$ npm install
$ npm start
